                Bears are heavily built, short-tailed mammals with large skulls and strong jaws. They have large, strong paws with long claws. The biggest bears can kill another animal with just a single blow from their paws. Some bears are excellent climbers. Although bears are part of the group of mammals called carnivores (meat-eaters), most of them are omnivores and will eat almost anything. Bears prefer to live alone, except for mothers taking care of their young. Bears have an excellent sense of smell, which they rely on to find food, but their eyesight and hearing are not as good as some other carnivores.

                Giraffes are even-toed hoofed mammals. They have two toes on each foot, and each toe is covered with a hard casing called a hoof. They are herbivores (plant-eaters). The giraffe lives in Africa, but they are found in different places. Giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in small herds. The giraffe, with its long neck, is the tallest living animal. Males are able to reach a height of 18ft (5.5m. Male giraffes tend to be taller than females and can feed on the higher branches of trees. This height difference means that male and female giraffes do not have to fight for food. Like most other hoofed mammals, giraffes sleep standing up.

                Lions are the only cats to live in groups, called prides. The role of the male lion is to protect his pride and territory from rival males. He does this by pacing around his territory and roaring. He also sprays his urine, which releases a strong-smelling substance to warn off other lions. The females have the job of hunting to feed the group. Lionesses also look after the cubs of the pride. Several females may give birth at similar times and produce milk for each other's cubs. Lions are most active at night, when it is cooler. By day, they spend their time resting and sleeping in the shade, getting up only for the occasional drink or to play.

                Monkeys are closely related to apes; monkeys are primates that have a tail and usually live in trees. In some species, the tail is longer than the rest of the body. Monkeys have a relatively large brain and they use their nimble, grasping hands for tasks such as gathering food and picking apart fruit. They are good climbers, and they live mainly in tropical forests.

                Alligators belong to a group of reptiles called crocodilians. They are powerful predators with long snouts and big, side-flattened tails. The scales on their skin are especially thick and many are reinforced with bony plates. Some crocodilians have jaws that are strong enough to crush bone. The biggest kinds can snatch large animals, such as antelope, from the banks of rivers and drag them beneath the water to drown. Others take smaller prey, and a few feed on fish.
